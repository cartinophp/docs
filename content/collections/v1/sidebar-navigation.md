# Sidebar
Dok comes with different sidebar navigation templates that you can choose from.
```files
└── docs/partials/sidebar/navigation/
    ├── _collapse.antlers.html
    ├── _default.antlers.html
```


The `default` partial is used as the starting template. Feel free to try out the others to see what works best for you. Just change the references to that partial within your views.
